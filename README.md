📘 Overview

This assignment focuses on the fundamental concepts of Python strings and tuples. It is designed to help beginners understand how to manipulate text data and work with immutable sequences effectively.

The tasks in this assignment cover:

String concatenation

String slicing and indexing

String methods and transformations

Tuple creation, modification, and access

🔹 Objective

The main objective of this assignment is to:

Strengthen the understanding of basic string operations in Python.

Explore string manipulation techniques like slicing, indexing, and method usage.

Practice tuple handling including concatenation, repetition, and element access.

🧠 Topics Covered

String Concatenation

Combining multiple strings including user input.

Extending strings by adding additional messages.

String Slicing and Indexing

Accessing specific characters and substrings.

Reversing strings using slicing.

Extracting specific words from within a string.

String Methods

Converting cases (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize).

Counting occurrences of characters.

Replacing words within a string.

Tuples (Creation, Modification, and Access)

Creating tuples with numeric values.

Performing concatenation and repetition.

Accessing specific and range-based tuple elements.

📊 Learning Outcomes

After completing this assignment, students will be able to:

Apply different string operations for real-world text processing.

Understand the importance and use of immutable data types like tuples.

Use Python slicing and indexing efficiently.

Enhance overall Python programming logic and readability.

🧩 Assignment Structure

The assignment consists of four main sections:

String Concatenation – Working with user input and combining strings.

String Slicing & Indexing – Extracting and reversing parts of a string.

String Methods – Applying built-in functions for transformation and search.

Tuples – Demonstrating creation, concatenation, and element access.

🧾 Example Output

The program outputs demonstrate:

A personalized greeting message using string concatenation.

Various sliced and indexed parts of the string.

Transformed versions of the string using different methods.

Tuple operations such as concatenation, repetition, and element retrieval.
